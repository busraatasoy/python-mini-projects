# 📂 Banker Roulette Game

This folder contains the code script used for the **Banker Roulette Game** project.  

# 🎯 **Project Purpose**
- The goal is to simulate a situation at a restaurant where a group of friends places their credit cards on the table, and the waiter randomly selects one card.
- The person who owns the selected card will pay the bill.

# 🕵️‍♀️Hint:
- Use the **random.choice()** function to randomly pick a friend from the list.
- Alternatively, you can use **random.randint()** to generate a random index and access the friend from the list using that index.

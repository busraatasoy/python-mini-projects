# 📂 Heads and Tails Program

This folder contains the code script used for the **Heads and Tails Program** project.  

# 🎯 **Project Purpose**
The goal is to simulates heads and tails. When the user runs the program, a random selection is made and either “Heads” or “Tails” is printed on the screen.

# 🕵️‍♀️Hint:
- Use the **random.randint()** function to generate either 0 or 1.
- Then use an **if statement** to print 'Heads' for 0 and 'Tails' for 1.

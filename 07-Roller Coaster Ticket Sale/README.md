# 📂 Roller Coaster Ticket Sale

📌This folder contains the code script used for the **Roller Coaster Ticket Sale** project.  

# 🎯 **Project Purpose**
- The goal is to simulate a ticket sales system for a roller coaster. 
- It will calculate the ticket price according to the user’s information such as height, age, photo purchase.

# 🕵️‍♀️Hint:
- **Height Check:** First, we check if the person is tall enough to roller coaster. If they are at least 120 cm tall, we ask their age. If not, the ticket is not sold.
- **Age-Based Pricing:** Then checks the user’s age to determine the ticket price.
- If they are 12 or younger, they pay $5 for a child ticket.

- If they are between 13 and 18, they pay $7 for a youth ticket.

- If they are between 45 and 55, they get a free ride due to a “midlife crisis.”

- Anyone else pays $12 for an adult ticket.

- **Photo Option:** After determining the ticket price, the program asks the user if they want to buy a photo. If they say “yes” (y), an additional $3 is added to the final bill.
- **Output:** Finally, the program prints the total bill or a message that the user is too short to ride.

# 📂 The FizzBuzz Game

📌This folder contains the code script used for the **The FizzBuzz Game** project.  

# 🎯 **Project Purpose**
- The goal is to create a simple program used to teach basic logic and iteration in programming.
- The objective is to print numbers from 1 to a user-defined maximum number.

- However, instead of printing the number itself:

- If the number is divisible by 3, print “Fizz”.

- If the number is divisible by 5, print “Buzz”.

- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”.

# 🕵️‍♀️Hint:
- **Input handling:** Ask the user to input the maximum number for the FizzBuzz game.
- **Loop through numbers:** You need to loop from 1 to the user-defined maximum number (inclusive). 
- In Python, you can use **range(1, end_number + 1)** to generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 to end_number.
- **Conditional checks:** Use **if, elif, and else** to check if a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.
- **Output the result:** Depending on the conditions, print either “Fizz”, “Buzz”, “FizzBuzz”, or the number itself.

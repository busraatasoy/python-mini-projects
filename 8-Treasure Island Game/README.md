# 📂 Treasure Island Game

📌This folder contains the code script used for the **Treasure Island Game** project.  

# 🎯 **Project Purpose**
- The goal is to create an interactive text-based adventure game where the player is tasked with finding a treasure. 
- The game guides the player through a series of choices, with each choice leading to a different outcome. 
- If the player makes the right decisions, they win the treasure; if they make the wrong choices, they lose the game.
# 🕵️‍♀️Hint:
- The game uses **if statements** to guide the player through different choices.
- After each choice, the program checks the **input** and leads to different outcomes.
- Remember to **use .lower()** to handle case-insensitive inputs.
- Make sure to **define consequences** for each choice (e.g., winning or losing the game).
- We can visualize the treasure using **ASCII Table**.

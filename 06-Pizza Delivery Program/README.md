# 📂 Pizza Delivery Program

📌This folder contains the code script used for the **Pizza Delivery Program** project.  

# 🎯 **Project Purpose**
- The goal is to simulates a simple pizza ordering system where the user selects their pizza size and additional toppings. 
- Based on their choices, the program calculates and displays the final bill.

# 🕵️‍♀️Hint:
- Use **if-elif-else statements** to determine the price based on the user’s choice.
- Store **the total price in a bill variable** and update it according to the selected options.
- Use string methods **(.upper())** to avoid case sensitivity issues in user input.
- Use **f-strings** for clear output formatting.

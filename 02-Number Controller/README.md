# 📂 Number Controller

📌This folder contains the code script used for the **Number Controller** project.  

# 🎯 **Project Purpose**
The goal is to find out whether the number the user wants to check is odd or even.

# 🕵️‍♀️Hint:
- Use the modulus operator % to check if a **number is divisible by 2**.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.
